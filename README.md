# How about a Rust handler in serverless framework?

Lambda's can have arbitrary runtimes now. Serverless Framework offers
the _aws-provided_ template. Can we use this to have a Rust
backend deployed by SLS?

Turns out someone already built the necessary plugin.  I'll work this
example out to the end so y'all can see it working.
