# How about a Rust handler in Serverless Framework?

Started developing this from the `aws-provided` template but then
discovered a bunch of work has already been done on a Rust
plugin for Serverless Framework.

So just check this out and `sls deploy` it. It's pretty much
100% copied from https://github.com/softprops/serverless-aws-rust-http.
